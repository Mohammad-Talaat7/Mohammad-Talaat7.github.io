This GPU Programming Specialization from [*Johns Hopkins University*](https://www.jhu.edu/) provides comprehensive training in harnessing the power of Graphics Processing Units for general-purpose computing. The 4-course series covers:

- **Introduction to Concurrent Programming with GPUs**
- **Introduction to Parallel Programming with CUDA**
- **CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise**
- **CUDA Advanced Libraries**

Through hands-on projects, I developed expertise in writing high-performance parallel code using CUDA and learned to leverage GPU-accelerated libraries for computationally intensive tasks in fields like machine learning, image processing, and data science.

## Key Skills Acquired

- Developing CUDA software for massive parallel computations.
- Transforming sequential CPU algorithms into parallel GPU kernels.
- Utilizing CUDA libraries (cuFFT, cuBLAS, cuDNN) for accelerated computing.
- Implementing concurrent programming in C/C++ and Python.
- Optimizing code for NVIDIA GPU architectures.
- Building enterprise-scale GPU applications.

## Projects & Applied Learning

- Developed CUDA-based solutions for image/signal processing
- Created interactive GPU computational processing kernels
- Implemented parallel algorithms achieving significant speedups over CPU versions
- Built machine learning software using cuDNN and cuTensor libraries

## Significance

This specialization represents:
- 4 months of intensive study (recommended 10 hrs/week)
- Mastery of cutting-edge parallel computing techniques
- Practical skills applicable to AI, data science, and scientific computing
- Certification from a top-ranked university (Johns Hopkins)

## Prerequisites

- 1+ year of programming experience (preferably C/C++)
- Familiarity with basic algorithms and data structures
- Comfort with command-line development environments
