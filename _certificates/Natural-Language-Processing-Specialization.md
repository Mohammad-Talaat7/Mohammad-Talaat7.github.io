This Natural Language Processing Specialization, offered by [*DeepLearning.AI*](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) and taught by NLP experts [**Younes Bensouda Mourri**](https://younesmourri.com) (Stanford) and [**Łukasz Kaiser**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JWmiQR0AAAAJ&hl=en) (Google Brain), provides comprehensive training in cutting-edge NLP techniques. The 4-course series covers:

1. **Classification and Vector Spaces**: Logistic regression, naïve Bayes, word vectors, sentiment analysis, and machine translation
2. **Probabilistic Models**: Dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, word embeddings for autocorrection and POS tagging
3. **Sequence Models**: Dense/recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs for advanced sentiment analysis and named entity recognition
4. **Attention Models**: Encoder-decoder, causal/self-attention architectures for machine translation, summarization, and question-answering using Transformers (T5, BERT)

Through hands-on projects, I gained practical experience building NLP applications that perform sentiment analysis, language translation, text summarization, and chatbot functionality using Hugging Face Transformers.

## Key Skills Acquired

- Implemented state-of-the-art NLP models including Transformers, BERT, and T5
- Built sentiment analysis systems using logistic regression and naïve Bayes
- Developed word embedding models (Word2Vec) and vector space analysis
- Created sequence models (RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs) for text generation and NER
- Designed attention-based models for machine translation and summarization
- Applied locality-sensitive hashing for approximate nearest neighbor search
- Utilized TensorFlow, Trax, and Hugging Face libraries

## Projects & Applied Learning

- Built an English-to-French translation algorithm using word embeddings
- Created a tweet sentiment analyzer using logistic regression and naïve Bayes
- Developed a named entity recognition system with LSTMs
- Implemented text summarization using encoder-decoder architectures
- Designed a question-answering system with BERT and Transformer models

- 4 months of intensive study (recommended 6 hrs/week)
- Mastery of cutting-edge NLP techniques used in industry
- Practical skills applicable to AI, data science, and software development
- Certification from DeepLearning.AI, created by AI pioneer Andrew Ng
- Hands-on experience with real-world NLP applications

## Prerequisites

- Working knowledge of machine learning
- Intermediate Python programming
- Proficiency in calculus, linear algebra, and statistics
- Familiarity with deep learning frameworks (helpful but not required)
